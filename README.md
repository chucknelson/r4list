# r4list
A simple list web app implemented in Rails 4.0.

> This project has been archived because it was finally time to move past Rails 4. It now lives on as [Fliplist](https://github.com/chucknelson/fliplist).

## Development
The recommended way for developing `r4list` is with Visual Studio Code's [Remote - Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension.
